# Catalog Smart Contracts

The original hackathon project for catalog.works.
  
This code allows an artist to register their account with Catalog to sell music and mint social tokens. Purchasers of an artist's music are minted social tokens, which can be staked to earn a percentage of future sales. 
  
The implementation of staking & reward distribution is based on this paper: https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad71ffeb79acc67c8bcdaba/5ad8d1193a40977462982470_scalable-reward-distribution-paper.pdf
